<Notes>


Hi, I'm going to be presenting

a side project app of mine called

kind cloud

Before I get started...

I'd like to thank JSMN

for having me

and for providing such a great place

to give talks and meet other coders in the Twin Cities.

Kudos to the whole board, thank you.

# History

# üò¢

</Layout>


<Notes>


Many years back

I was going through a really bad time at work

In particular with a coworker

We had gone from a really great mentorship relationship to

one where I dreaded going to work

After a while I realized it was workplace bullying

Which is a really weird thing to realize as an adult

Like, how can this be?

It dawned on me because I'd try different approaches with him and he'd consitently find new ways to make my experience bad.

So I realized it wasn't based on anything I was saying

# Research

So I did what I do with all problems...

I obsessively researched bullying

## Self-compassion

# üîë

</Layout>


<Notes>


Through my research I found a study

that found a link between low self-compassion

and being a bully or a victim of bullying

## Loving-kindness

# ‚ù§Ô∏è

</Layout>


<Notes>


Found loving-kindness meditation or metta

I'm not an expert on the orgins of loving-kindness

but I really loved how it worked and how algorithmic it is

So I'd use this meditation and it really did help calm me.

# How it works

### Say kind things to...

‚≠êÔ∏è Yourself

‚ù§Ô∏è A loved one

‚ö™Ô∏è A neutral party

‚ö°Ô∏è Someone you find difficult

A larger community

</Layout>


<Notes>


I had a hard time remembering which one I was on

so I thought an app would be perfect for it
